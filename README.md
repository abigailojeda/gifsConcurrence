#Concurrency in javascript requests
Just an exercise to practice concurrency in an Angular project.

##ðŸŽ¯OBJECTIVES
- Make requests to an array of urls limiting the concurrency with a MAX_CONCURRENCY
- Testing  

##ðŸŽ‰RESULTS
- I have made a service for the requests, one version using rxjs and another one using javascript fetch
- I have made a small test to check that the requests are divided into blocks according to MAX_CONCURRENCY and if all the requests are made
- I used the GIPHY API to test the code and make it more visual and fun.
